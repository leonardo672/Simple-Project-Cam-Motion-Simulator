## Mechanical Logic:
The program models the motion of a cam-follower mechanism. It considers parameters such as harmonic rise, harmonic fall, time intervals, and base circle radius. Different phases of the cam-follower motion are handled with specific conditions, which is consistent with mechanical systems that exhibit different behaviors at different times.

## Mathematical Logic:
The program uses mathematical expressions to calculate angular velocity, cam angle, follower displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Specific mathematical formulas are employed to model follower motion during different time intervals. The inclusion of trigonometric functions (sin, cos) is consistent with the mathematical representation of circular motion.

## Programming Logic:
The program logically represents the behavior of a cam-follower system using mathematical models. It utilizes programming constructs, such as loops and conditions, to simulate and capture different phases of the system's motion. User inputs and calculated results are handled in a logical sequence. The logic is contingent on the accuracy of the mathematical model and the appropriateness of the conditions used to simulate the mechanical system.
